Fix ctrl+«number» behavior in afreecatv’s VOD watcher.

If you are watching a VOD and you press a key combination such as ctrl+1 or ctrl+9, the afreecatv VOD player will skip to 10% through 90%. This script intercepts the keypress and prevents you from losing your position when trying to switch browser tabs.
